    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We are three second year students at Boston University’s Entry-Level Occupational Therapy Doctorate Program. We have no experience with coding and are learning through this experience! Our mission is to increase accessibility in an occupation that is a part of many individuals' everyday lives – meal preparation, or “planning, preparing, and serving well-balanced, nutritious meals” (AOTA, 2020). We believe that anyone can cook!<br><br>Cooking is not only about making food, but it is rooted in nutrition, and has shown to foster mitigation of psychological distress and promote well being (Farmer & Cotter, 2021). Cooking can help individuals develop good work ethic, time management skills, math and literacy (Delussey, 2023).<br><br>Reading and following recipes are essential steps to meal preparation. Recipe literacy can promote kitchen safety, kitchen hygiene and increase independence for youth and individuals (Delussey, 2023). Educating individuals in kitchen-literacy may play a role in “preventing and reducing diet-related chronic diseases and nutrition disparities” (Oleschuk et al., 2023). However, reading and implementing recipes can be a big barrier for individuals with disabilities. Specifically, individuals with visual impairments, cognitive impairments, and learning disabilities.<br><br>The goal for our website “Anyone Can Cook!” is to be able to convert any recipe into an accessible format. We want a user to be able to input a link to our website and it will be converted to an accessible format. This product implements universal design (meaning it is accessible to anyone), however our target audience is individuals who have visual, cognitive impairments and learning disabilities.

    <p>Due to time constraints and our limited experience with coding, we created a prototype that showcases one recipe chosen by us and how they would be modified to be more accessible. We hope that in the future this website can use any recipe found online and convert them into this accessible format.
